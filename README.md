# RSA-Encryption-8-bit
Simplified RSA algorithm encrypting one letter.

RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is an algorithm used by modern computers to encrypt and decrypt messages. It is an
asymmetric cryptographic algorithm. In this implementation, Java is the language used. There are 8 sections in this
report in order to accomplish the encryption and decryption: Modular, GCD, Phi Function, Square and Multiply,
Miller-Rabin Test, Generating Primes, RSA Encryption and RSA Decryption.
